# Mini-Bank-Core-Java-Project
**In this project create Mini Bank application that will have the following funcationalities.** <br>
*View and Fetch Account Details<br>
*Deposit and Withdraw Money<br>
*view Previous Transactions<br>
*Calculate Savings Interest<br>
We will be using all the major Java programming concets such as variables and data tupes, loops, conditionals, and more.
With that, we will also try to implement and Object-Oriented Programming concepts
The very first step would be to accept the customer name and unique banking ID from the User followed b the user choice from the avilable menu.
following would be the main menu Options-
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Previous Transaction
5. Exit <br>
Depending on the choice entered.

  The Approaching the Projectthe major focus of the project would be on Object-Oriented Programming, we will have a class that would be responsible for the creation of the user account object. A single account object would represent one customer.Thus, the idea behind using Object-Oriented Programming is to bring the factor of reusability.Therefore, this software can be used by as many users as needed by just creating a new object.
